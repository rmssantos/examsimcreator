## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: With Local Server (Recommended)

The local server enables full functionality including automatic exam detection and image loading.

```bash
# Navigate to the portable folder
cd path/to/portable

# Start the server (Python)
python server.py

# Or use Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000
```

The server will automatically:
- Start on `http://localhost:8000`
- Open your browser
- Detect exams in `user-content/exams/`
- Enable drag & drop imports

**Stop the server:** Press `Ctrl+C`

---

### Option 2: Direct File Opening (Limited)

For quick access without a server (some features may be limited):

1. Navigate to the `portable` folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. Manually import exams via drag & drop

**Limitations:**
- Cannot auto-detect exams in folders (browser security)
- Images may not load properly
- Must import exams manually

## 📋 Usage Modes

### Mode Comparison

| Feature | Without Server (`file://`) | With Server (`localhost`) |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Auto-detection** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Drag & drop import** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Full metadata** | ⚠️ Generic | ✅ Complete |
| **Images** | ⚠️ May fail | ✅ Always works |
| **Beautiful cards** | ⚠️ Generic | ✅ Customized |
| **Setup** | None | Python/Node required |

### Recommendation

- **Use Server Mode** if you want automatic exam detection and full features
- **Use File Mode** if you only need one exam and prefer maximum simplicity

---

## 📦 Importing Exams

### Method 1: Automatic Detection (Server Mode Only)

1. Place exam folders in `user-content/exams/`
2. Each folder should contain:
   - `dump.json` (required) - Question data
   - `metadata.json` (optional) - Exam information
   - `images/` (optional) - Image assets
3. Start the server
4. Exams appear automatically on the homepage

**Example structure:**
```
user-content/exams/my-exam/
├── dump.json
├── metadata.json
└── images/
    ├── question1.jpg
    └── diagram2.png
```

---

### Method 2: Drag & Drop Import (Both Modes)

1. Open the simulator in your browser
2. Drag a `dump.json` file anywhere on the homepage
3. The exam is imported and stored in `localStorage`
4. A card appears immediately (may show generic metadata)

---

### Method 3: Using Python Generator

Convert exam dumps to JavaScript format:

```bash
# Generate exam-data.js from dump files
python generate-exam-data-js.py

# This creates exam-data.js which is automatically loaded
```

---

## 📝 Creating Custom Exams

### Using the Built-in Editor

1. Open `editor.html` in your browser
2. Create or select an exam
3. Add questions with the visual editor:
   - Single/multiple choice
   - Drag & drop
   - Sequence ordering
   - Y/N matrices
4. Add images, explanations, and metadata
5. Save (auto-syncs to `localStorage` and `window.userExams`)
6. Export as JSON to share

### Question Types Supported

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **STANDARD** | Single choice | Traditional multiple choice (1 answer) |
| **MULTI** | Multiple choice | Select multiple correct answers |
| **SEQUENCE** | Ordering | Arrange items in correct order |
| **DRAG_DROP_SELECT** | Drag & drop | Select N items from a list |
| **YES_NO_MATRIX** | Matrix | Answer Yes/No for each statement |

4. Settings saved to `localStorage`

---

## 📊 Data Storage

### Dual Storage Strategy

Questions are stored in two locations for reliability:

1. **localStorage** - `custom_${examId}_questions`
   - Persistent across browser sessions
   - Survives page refreshes
   - Limited to ~5-10MB per origin

2. **window.userExams** - In-memory object
   - Available immediately without reload
   - Used for live exam sessions
   - Cleared on page refresh (reloaded from localStorage)

### Storage Keys

```javascript
// Questions (per exam)
localStorage['custom_<examId>_questions']  // e.g., custom_myexam_questions

// Metadata (per exam)
localStorage['exam_metadata_<examId>']     // e.g., exam_metadata_myexam

// Activation config
localStorage['exam_activation_config']

// Progress tracking (per exam)
localStorage['<examId>_progress']          // e.g., myexam_progress

// Theme preference
localStorage['theme']
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No exams found" (Server Mode)

**Causes:**
- Exam folders missing from `user-content/exams/`
- Missing `dump.json` files
- Server not running

**Solutions:**
1. Check that `user-content/exams/` contains exam folders
2. Verify each folder has `dump.json`
3. Restart the server
4. Check browser console (F12) for errors

---

### Images Not Loading

**Causes:**
- Using `file://` protocol instead of server
- Incorrect image paths in `dump.json`
- Missing image files

**Solutions:**
1. **Use server mode** (`python server.py`)
2. Verify image paths are relative to `images/` folder
3. Check filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Ensure images exist in `user-content/exams/{exam-id}/images/`

---

### Dark Mode Not Working

**Causes:**
- Browser cache showing old CSS
- Theme preference not saved

**Solutions:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if theme icon toggles (moon/sun)
4. Inspect element to verify `.dark-mode` class is on `<body>`

---

### Progress Cards Show No Data

**Causes:**
- No exam attempts completed yet
- localStorage cleared

**Solutions:**
1. Complete at least one exam to generate progress data
2. Check if other progress features work (View Detailed Stats)
3. Progress is stored per-exam with `${examId}_progress` key

---

### Card Shows Generic Name Instead of Exam Name

**Cause:** Manual drag & drop import without metadata

**Solutions:**
1. Add `metadata.json` to the exam folder
2. Use server mode for auto-generated metadata
3. Or accept generic metadata for quick testing

---

### Save Not Persisting in Editor

**Causes:**
- Browser localStorage disabled
- Storage quota exceeded

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser settings (allow localStorage)
2. Clear old exam data to free space
3. Export questions as JSON backup
4. Reload page and try again

---

3. Keeps distribution lightweight and flexible

**Option B: All-in-One Bundle**
1. Include simulator + pre-installed exam packs
2. Larger download but ready to use immediately

### Creating Exam Packages

```bash
# Structure for distribution
exam-pack/
